🚦 Traffic Management System using Python and YOLO Technology
📄 Overview
This project is a smart traffic management system designed to monitor and control vehicular traffic using computer vision. The system leverages Python along with the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm to detect vehicles in real-time and manage traffic signals intelligently.

The goal is to reduce congestion, improve road safety, and enable efficient traffic flow in urban areas.

🎯 Features
✅ Real-time vehicle detection using YOLO

✅ Automatic traffic signal control based on vehicle density

✅ Camera-based continuous monitoring

✅ Flexible threshold-based traffic decision logic

✅ Data logging for analysis and future improvements

🧰 Technologies Used
Python — core programming language

OpenCV — for image and video processing

YOLO (v3/v4/v5) — for real-time object detection

NumPy — for numerical computations

Tkinter / Flask (optional) — for GUI or web dashboard

💻 How It Works
1️⃣ Video feeds from traffic cameras are analyzed frame by frame.
2️⃣ YOLO detects vehicles (cars, trucks, bikes, etc.) in each frame.
3️⃣ The system counts the number of vehicles in each lane.
4️⃣ Based on vehicle density, the traffic signal durations are dynamically adjusted to reduce congestion.
5️⃣ Alerts or logs are generated for abnormal traffic conditions.

⚙️ Setup and Installation
bash
Copy
Edit
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/traffic-management-system.git
cd traffic-management-system

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
YOLO Weights:

Download pre-trained YOLO weights (e.g., YOLOv3 weights) from the official YOLO website or link provided in the repo.

Place them in the designated weights/ folder.

🚀 Running the System
bash
Copy
Edit
python traffic_system.py
For real-time camera feed, connect a webcam or CCTV camera.

For testing, you can use sample video files.
